This program uses multithreading, synchronization mechanisms (mutexes, semaphores, barriers) and sockets IO ( for client-server interaction). In the server.c file is contained the server side and in the client.c client-side code. In other files are contained assets (images, etc.) and other functions that are used by client and server.
